# Author

# Installations
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- GLFW (OpenGL library)
- GLAD (OpenGL loader)

# Summary
This game employs lots of moving targets and navigation between screens to create a fun target practice. The user clicks to shoot at a moving object and destroys it. Each level has different movement patterns, colors, and win conditions, and the program tracks the user's accuracy. As you hit more targets, you accumulate points to eventually win. The end screen shows where you can move to the next level, or give the one you just played another go. There are even two modes, and the hardmode makes the targets move quicker and more erratically. I hope you enjoy!
